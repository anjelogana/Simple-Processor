The purpose of this project was to create a simple processor by using the 4 distinct components to create a cpu.
1. Register [Used a D-Flip-Flop]
2. Control Unit [Used a Moore FSM & 4x16 Decoder]
3. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
4. Control Bus

The VHDL File was created on Fall 2022, and the Verilog File was created on Summer 2023.

Creator of these files is Anjelo Gana

For the Verilog File, I have gone through the 3 steps of a build process.
1. Writing the HDL Code
2. Simulate the HDL Code using EDA Playground [Cloud Simulator]
3. Test FPGA on Hardware
